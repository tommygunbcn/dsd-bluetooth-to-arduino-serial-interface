# dsd-bluetooth-to-arduino-serial-interface
a hardware interface for a serial bluetooth device working at 3v3 wit arduino working with 5 v

Many commercial converters does not work , since arduino needs a 5v rail to rail signal to "understant" serial communication in it rx pin.
This works for me, working at 115200 bauds per sec.
